<h1>Mafia vs Police  <br> THE GAME</h1>

Ok so.... this is a random game with:
Thread
Semaphore

ALL IN C#
yup... I don't have a soul anymore


<h1> I NEED TO RE-DO EVERYTHING </h1>
Map must be object[,] not int[,] <br>
Mafia = 2 <br>
Police = 1 <br>
I need to fix show_Matrix function cus it doesn't show pipes but only G and P ( Honestly in pretty good )
